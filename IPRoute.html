    <p class="lead">The next topic, we are going to discuss are IP addresses, Packets, and the  Process of Routing. First, what is IP Address? IP stands for Internet Protocol, basic rules to follow on the internet. This protocol was created by Vint Cerf and Bob Khan and became the basic groundwork for the computer. An IP address is a computer digital address, basically computers ways to speaking and send information to one another!
 </p>
    <p class ="lead"> ow the information being sent from one computer to the other is called Packets. The internet is divided into packets and every time you go into a website, the computer collects that information. What controls how packets arrive from one destination to another? Routing transfers packets to point A to B. Routers are basically traffic managers to keep these routes clear and on the right path to the destination. TCP goes through packets and follows through with delivery make users get proper information.</p>
